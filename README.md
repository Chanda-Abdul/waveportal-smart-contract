## Wave Portal
[BuildSpace.io "Wave Portal" Project](https://app.buildspace.so/projects/CO02cf0f1c-f996-4f50-9669-cf945ca3fb0b) to 
- create an Ethereum Smart Contract with Solidity and deploy to the blockchain
- build Web3 client app to interact with your contract

# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
